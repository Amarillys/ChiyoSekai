On source code mode, you need a node.js. And Run these commands:

`npm install`
`npm start`

## To-Do:

+ √ - Status Bar
+ √ - Volume Bar
+ X - User Window
+ X - Info Window
  ...

## Usage:

### Settings and Configs

​	The settings and configs are saving in a file named 'config.json', which saved in **%UserProfile%/Documents/ChiyoSekai(Windows)**. This file saves the userdata while using.

### Playlists

​	Playlists are saved in %UserProfile%/Documents/ChiyoSekai/playlists(Windows)

### For Custom style
    put your css file in %UserProfile%/Documents/ChiyoSekai/custom.css(Windows)
    and I can give a sample:

``` css
body {
    background-image: url(file:///C:/Users/AlteraCave/Documents/ChiyoSekai/tinkle.jpg);
    background-size: cover;
}
```
